Problem Statement:
Gushing through the crowd, pushing your way through , only to find out that your room number isn’t on that notice board , during the exams. What do you do then ? Rush towards another board and repeat the same thing all over again ? Clock’s ticking! Question papers have been distributed. The struggle’s real.
